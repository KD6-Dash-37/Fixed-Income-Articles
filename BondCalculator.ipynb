    "# Bond Price Calculator\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first article, we explored the determinants of a bond price using the open and closed forms of the bond price formula. Using the formulae, we were pricing an annual paying bond and there was a built-in assumption that we were settling the bond on a coupon date as we did not account for accrued interest. In this article, we are going to build a bond pricing calculator that can price any bullet bond. A bullet bond pays a single fixed coupon rate throughout the life of the bond and it will only redeem its principal/face amount at maturity. \n",
    "\n",
    "The calculator will be able to price a bond on any settlement date that falls between the issue and maturity date of the bond. Accounting for the time value of the bond's cash flows and adjust the price for accrued interest, both relative to the input settlement date.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Settlement Date\n",
    "The settlement date is the actual date that the security is exchanged for cash, this typically happens one or two business days after the bond was traded, market convention is to refer to this as T+1 or T+2. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Accrued Interest\n",
    "Accrued interest is interest earned while holding the bond but has not yet been paid to the bondholder. For example, if you buy an annual paying bond just after it paid a coupon and you then held and traded it a week before it paid the coupon, should you not be compensated for the time that you held the bond? When you go to settle the bond after trading it you will receive the traded price of the bond, known as the clean, flat or gross price of the bond, it will then be adjusted for the 'earned' interest, as the bond seller this will increase the amount of cash you will receive. This final amount is known as the dirty, full or net price. In some markets, bonds are quoted in terms of dirty prices but the majority of markets quote bonds using clean prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{accrued interest} = \\text{coupon} \\times\\frac{\\text{days accrued}}{\\text{days between coupons}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\text{where:}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\text{days accrued}= \\text{settlement date}-\\text{last coupon date}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\text{days between coupons}= \\text{next coupon date}-\\text{last coupon date} $\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, this is fixed income so it not always as simple to subtract one date from another. For example, if we use an actual/actual (the ratio here is describing the number of days per month and year) date calendar then chronologically the distribution of coupons is correct but this will end up in varying $\\text{days accrued}$ and $\\text{days between coupons}$ which in turn will also result in varying coupon amounts. US treasuries that pay a coupon use Act/Act. Whilst corporate bonds typically use 30/360 which assumes that each month has thirty days and a year has 360 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Excel you can for example use the DAYS() and DAYS360() function to calculate the number of days between dates for both conventions. There are actually three different 30/360 methods which I will not go into detail here but ISDA has a very useful file on their page via this link:\n",
    "https://www.isda.org/2008/12/22/30-360-day-count-conventions/ \n",
    "\n",
    "In our Python code we are going to use a module called yearfrac created by: https://github.com/kmedian/yearfrac \n",
    "\n",
    "It has several functions that return the decimal year(s) between two given dates using different day count conventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Which Formula Should We use?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last article we introduced the open and closed form bond price formulae, so which one should we use for our bond calculator? Let's first set some objectives for our code. We want to be able to price a bond:\n",
    "\n",
    "* On any date while the bond is active, in other words after it's issue and before it's maturity date;\n",
    "* For any coupon frequency, annual, semi-annual, quarterly are the most common;\n",
    "* Using different interest rates rather than a flat rate (in this article we are going to use a flat yield but the ability to have time dependent rates will become very useful later).\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's revisit our formulas!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Open-Form:\n",
    "\n",
    "### $$B=\\sum_{t=1}^{T}\\frac{C_{t}}{\\left( 1+i_{t} \\right)^{t}}+\\frac{B_{T}}{\\left( 1+i_{T} \\right)^{T}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Closed-Form:\n",
    "\n",
    "### $$\\frac{B}{B_{T}}=\\frac{\\frac{C}{B_{T}}}{i} \\left[ 1-\\frac{1}{\\left( 1+ i \\right)^{T}} \\right]+\\frac{1}{\\left( 1+i\\right)^{T}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\text{where:}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$ B=\\text{Bond Value}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$t=\\text{Time, years until receipt of cash flow}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$T=\\text{Maturity of the bond, years}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$i_{t}=\\text{Interest rate for time, t or T}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$i=\\text{Constant yield}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$C_{t} = \\text{Coupon amount at time t}=\\frac{\\text{coupon rate}}{\\text{coupon frequency}} \\times \\text{face amount}$ *used in the open form formula*\n",
    "\n",
    "$C=\\text{Annual coupon amount}=\\text{coupon rate} \\times \\text{face amount}$, *used in the closed form formula*\n",
    "\n",
    "$B_{T}=\\text{Bond face value}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$m=\\text{Compound frequency}$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that both formulas meet our first requirement, $T$ does not have to be nice round number like your finance text book it can instead be a decimal year value. The open form will have time-dependent values for $t$ and $T$ and the closed form will have a single value for $T$ making it a simpler formula to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next constraint, different payment frequences. Now we introduce varying compounding frequencies given as $m$ which adjusts the interest rate and $t,T$\n",
    "\n",
    "### $$B=\\sum_{t=1}^{T}\\frac{C}{\\left( 1+\\frac{i_{t}}{m} \\right)^{t \\times m}}+\\frac{B_{T}}{\\left(1+\\frac{i_{t}}{m} \\right)^{T \\times m}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### $$\\frac{B}{B_{T}}=\\frac{\\frac{C}{B_{T}}}{\\frac{i}{m}} \\left[ 1-\\frac{1}{\\left( 1+ \\frac{i}{m} \\right)^{T \\times m}} \\right]+\\frac{1}{\\left( 1+\\frac{i}{m}\\right)^{T \\times {m}}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If compounded interest is new to the reader please see this video by Dr. Trefor Bazett:\n",
    "https://youtu.be/_sNMVHKcp9s\n",
    "\n",
    "Both formulas are still in the race and the closed-form still retains its advantage of being simpler without the summation of different terms. However, the closed-form falls short in that it cannot use time-dependent interest rates. I can not emphasize enough how useful the ability to have time-dependent interest rates will become later in several different calculations, models, and different types of securities/contracts/derivatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Our Bond\n",
    "In our first lines of code, we are going to use a named tuple to store our bond data. Named tuples are great for simpler data structures instead of defining a custom class. The first bond that we are going to price is a corporate bond that matures in 2027, pays a 10% coupon, semi-annually. It last paid a coupon on March 1st, 2021. We traded this bond on the 14th of July, 2021 at a yield of 6.5%. It settles on a T+2 convention which in turn means that it settles on the 16th of July."
